# Supervised-Learning
Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where models learn from labeled data to make predictions. The algorithm maps input features to known output labels, optimizing its performance using a loss function and an optimization algorithm (e.g., Gradient Descent).  Types: Classification: Predicts categories (e.g., spam detection).
